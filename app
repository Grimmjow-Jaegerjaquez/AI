Dear [HOD's Name],

I am writing to request permission to repeat the missed lab session in [Course Name] that I was unable to attend due to medical reasons.

Unfortunately, I had a medical emergency that prevented me from attending the scheduled lab session on [Date of missed lab session]. I have attached a copy of my medical certificate to this application as proof of my absence. The medical certificate indicates that I was unable to attend the lab session due to [reason for absence].

I understand that lab sessions are an important part of the curriculum, and I am willing to make every effort to ensure that I catch up on any missed work. I am aware that the lab sessions are vital in achieving the learning objectives of the course and I do not want to compromise my education.

Therefore, I am humbly requesting that I be allowed to repeat the missed lab session at a time that is convenient for you and the lab instructor. I am available to attend the makeup session at any time that is convenient for you and the lab instructor.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Student ID Number]
